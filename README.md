# best-of-ruby-quiz
I have been practicing my Ruby coding skills with the problems in Practical Programming's "Best Of Ruby Quiz" by Michael Edward Gray.
Each problem can be found in its own project subfolder, and my solution can be found in a file within each folder.  As of this writing (17Feb2015) I am including comments in each solution file.  At some later date I may decide to expand the file structure to place tests and comments in separate subfolders withing each project folder.
